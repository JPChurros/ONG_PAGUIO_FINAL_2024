Essentially for our game "Wild Whisker Shootout" we plan on creating a 2d shooter game that has multiple characters and stages. The core game mechanic will be that both players will race for a randomly generated ammo box in order to shoot the other; once this ammo box has been depleted another one will spawn on the map. 
The only exception to this rule would be if a player has lost a life which would lead to the ammo box being spawned closer to said player.

 There will be 3 characters, each having a different weapon/archetype:

Hedgehog – has a Shotgun, generally he takes longer to fire but he can throw out multiple bullet hitboxes at once.
Squirrel –  has an Uzi, generally he shoots quickly but the bullets deal less damage.
Cat – has a Pistol, will serve as our “default” character, he shoots at a moderate speed but only shoots one at a time.
In addition to this, there will also be 3 maps: Backyard, Forest, and Jungle, with each having unique characteristics allowing for different combinations and ideas of how the game can be played.
